# Security — Focus Areas

Generic baseline. `/agent-review:init` appends the repo-specific concerns; keep both.

**Authentication & authorization boundaries**

- Every server endpoint, background job, and privileged action independently verifies the caller's
  identity — never trusts a user id, tenant id, or role passed in from the client
- Authorization is enforced at the data layer (row/tenant scoping, ACL check), not only by hiding UI
- Look for: endpoints added without a session/permission check; ownership checks that compare
  against client-supplied identifiers; policy changes that widen who can read or write a record

**Privileged clients & credentials**

- Admin/service-level clients that bypass normal access control must stay server-only and must never
  be importable from browser or otherwise untrusted code
- Look for: privileged clients imported into client-side modules; secrets read in code that ships to
  the browser; credentials committed to the repo or baked into build artifacts

**Secrets exposure**

- Server-only environment variables must not be exposed through client-visible prefixes, build-time
  inlining, or error payloads
- Look for: new environment-variable references; API keys or tokens in logs, error messages, HTTP
  responses, or analytics events

**Input validation & injection**

- Untrusted input (request bodies, query params, headers, webhooks, third-party payloads, file
  uploads) is validated against an explicit schema before use
- Look for: raw string interpolation into SQL/shell/HTML/templates; parsers fed unvalidated JSON;
  client-side validation with no server-side counterpart; unbounded sizes and counts

**Cross-site and browser-surface risks**

- Look for: raw-HTML injection sinks; unsanitized user content rendered as markup; open redirects
  where a redirect target comes from a query parameter without an allowlist check; missing CSRF
  protection on state-changing requests; weakened CSP or security headers

**Session & cookie handling**

- Look for: session cookies missing `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite`; tokens stored where scripts can
  read them; sessions that are not invalidated on logout, password change, or privilege change;
  long-lived or non-rotating credentials

**Webhooks & third-party integrations**

- Look for: webhook handlers that parse and act on a payload before verifying the signature against
  the raw body; missing replay protection; secrets or tokens forwarded to the client

**Supply chain & CI**

- Look for: new dependencies (who maintains them, what they pull in); CI workflow changes that widen
  permission scopes, echo secrets, or let untrusted contributors trigger privileged jobs; changes to
  the review configuration itself that weaken risk scoring or strip checks
